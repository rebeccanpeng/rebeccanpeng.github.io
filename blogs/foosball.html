                                    Ever since the beginning of our time at Phenikaa MaaS, it's been easy to see how close the team is, 
                                    which has taught me that I think I really like the startup culture. It was also easy to tell that 
                                    most of the employees were genuinely excited for us to be there. As the week went on, more and more 
                                    people would try to talk to us, and if they couldn't speak English, they'd ask others to translate even 
                                    the simple questions like “do you like the food you're trying?” We've gotten treated to so many meals and 
                                    snacks, and I've been able to have conversations with so many people who want to hang out with us even 
                                    on the weekends just because they were afraid we'd be bored. 
                                </p>
        
                                <p>
                                    Though food is a close second for ways to bond, foosball has somehow become the single most important activity 
                                    in bringing me closer to my coworkers. In the company's break room, there is a foosball table that is a 
                                    prime source of entertainment every time we're on break. This is about twice a day— once after people are done 
                                    eating at lunchtime and another time in the afternoon when we have a snack/break time. At first, I would just stand 
                                    to the side and watch the games. These people were insanely good at foosball, a game that I didn't really think 
                                    had that much skill involved. My perception of foosball mostly is the view an 8 year old would have— maybe 
                                    spin the players around as quickly as possible and hope luck is on your side as the ball shoots across the table. 
                                    However, I was quickly shown otherwise. The employees were passing the ball to themselves and skillfully 
                                    maneuvering the ball, all while shooting the ball so fast that I was in disbelief over how strong their wrists must be.

                                    Eventually, I was encouraged to join in on the game with one of my coworkers. I somehow was 
                                    decent at it (honestly all by luck), and that began a trend of me joining in on the rotation of games 
                                    every time we had a break. During these games, I would often be playing with someone i didn't really 
                                    know as my partner, just trying my best to not shoot the ball into my own goal while my partner carried us. 
                                    Most of the time, I couldn't understand what was being said around me. I could tell they were all playfully 
                                    trash talking each other, and it was a joyous time for everyone. Laughter is universal after all, and 
                                    this time was always filled with so much laughing from all around that I learned to really enjoy playing. I 
                                    learned the Vietnamese word for “shoot the ball!” amongst all the playful noise that surrounded the foosball 
                                    table every time, and I even slowly picked up on more foosball strategy. Most importantly, my relationships 
                                    with the ~foosball regulars grew. Conversations were started as we stood around the table waiting for our turn, 
                                    and a camaraderie formed as I played more games. I never thought foosball would be my way of getting closer with 
                                    people, let alone in a foreign country at work, but I'm so glad that I got over my pointless fear of not 
                                    being good enough at the game and just trusted the kindness of my coworkers in being so welcoming.
